# Frontend Practice Projects
This repository contains a collection of small frontend projects created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
To make designs responsive and visually appealing, I sometimes use Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS — but no frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular are used.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:

Practice and improve core frontend development skills.

Build a personal library of mini-projects.

Explore UI/UX concepts while keeping things simple and framework-free.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 — Structure & semantics

CSS3 — Styling and layout (Flexbox, Grid)

JavaScript (ES6+) — Interactivity and DOM manipulation

Bootstrap — For quick responsive layouts

Tailwind CSS — For utility-first, fast styling
